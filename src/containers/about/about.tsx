                                    I'm a Portuguese Software Engineer, I like long walks on the beach, travelling
                                    and programming.

                                    On my right is an overview of the
                                    programming languages I've worked with.
                                    <br />
                                    I've also had to deal with quite a few frameworks and language super-sets,
                                    so if you've got a Flask/React/Etc project don't hesitate to ask me for my experience!

                                            It's my mother tongue, although I've been told I have a funny accent.

                                            All Portuguese come with the Spanish-language package by default.
                                            Many of the friends I've made throughout my life as an emigrant have been Spaniards,
                                            and as such I've developed a not-bad accent.
                                            <br/>
                                            Just don't ask me to write in Spanish, It's basically Portuguese with 
                                            the grammar all wrong, I can't for the life of me get it.

                                             in English for many years.
                                             <br/> I've even developed a killer impression of the accent,
                                              you can ask me about it on any occasion.

                                            In classical immigrant fashion, the number of words I know is in the dozens,
                                            and I get stumped when to native speakers talk to each other
