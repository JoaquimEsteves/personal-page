        `The project, codenamed streams, was designed, to parse and filter a database with more than 200 million entries!
        Users were also able to execute 'compute' functions on the data. These included classic regex wildcards and
        other fancier operations such as a dynamic pivot table that counted the and displayed any row!
        The data would then be presented to in a nice, user friendly way, in part thanks to a javascript library

            I'm particularly proud of the server-side data processing, as the interface queried the backend extensively for the next table of data!

        own scripting language <code>GAS</code> and later on by programming Excel Add-ins.

            By far the coolest project I had the pleasure to work with was the development of a nodal thermic
            simulator for the hyperloop tube!
            The program, entirely written in <code>Python</code> with some numpy on the side, would simulate heat transfers
            throughout the life cycle of a HyperLoop tube's use and show it all of in a cute <code>plotly</code> graph..
